PRIMME: PReconditioned Iterative MultiMethod Eigensolver
========================================================

PRIMME, pronounced as *prime*, finds a number of eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors of a 
real symmetric, or complex hermitian matrix A. Largest, smallest and interior 
eigenvalues are supported. Preconditioning can be used to accelerate 
convergence. 
PRIMME is written in C, but a complete Fortran 77 interface is also provided.
  
Making & Linking
----------------

`Make_flags` has the flags and compilers used to make `libprimme.a`. Set at minimum:

* `TOP`, path where the PRIMME directory is located.
* `CC`, compiler program like `gcc`, `clang` or `icc`. 

Then do this to generate `libprimme.a`::

    make lib

C Library Interface
-------------------

To solve real symmetric standard eigenproblems call::

    int dprimme(double *evals, double *evecs, double *resNorms, 
                primme_params *primme);

To solve Hermitian standard eigenproblems call::

    int zprimme(double *evals, Complex_Z *evecs, double *resNorms, 
                primme_params *primme);

The call arguments are:

* `evals`, array to return the found eigenvalues;
* `evecs`, array to return the found eigenvectors;
* `rNorms`, array to return the residual of the found eigenpairs; and
* `primme`, structure that specify the matrix problem, which eigenvalues are wanted and several method options.
